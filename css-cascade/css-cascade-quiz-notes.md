## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".
  // importance, specificity, source order, inheritance

- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
  // In CSS, source order refers to the order in which HTML elements appear in the document's source code. This order affects how styles are applied and resolved,

- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
  // This happens due to inheritance, where certain CSS properties (like color, font-family, etc.) are automatically passed down from a parent element to its children unless explicitly overridden.

- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
  // type-selector, class-selector, ID-selector

- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
  // is considered bad practice because it breaks the natural cascade and specificity of CSS, making styles harder to maintain and debug. It can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulties in overriding styles later on.
